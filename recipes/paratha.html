    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Breakfast, lunch, tea time, and dinner - this popular Indian pancake is available for a meal <br>
        or 
        snack. As kids we ate it sprinkled with sugar. It's typically served 
        with curry <br>and sambal if you choose to spice it up. </p>
    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
        <li> ¾ cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>    
        <li>   1 pinch white sugar</li> 
        <li>    4 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li> 3 ½ tablespoons clarified butter (ghee)</li>   
        <li>  1 egg</li>  
        <li> 1 teaspoon water</li>  
        <li>    2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter), divided </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix warm water, salt, and sugar together in a bowl. Put flour in a large mixing bowl;<br> 
            work in 3 1/2 tablespoons ghee using your fingertips.</li><br>
        <li>Beat egg and 1 teaspoon water together in a bowl; add to flour mixture. Gradually<br> mix warm water mixture into flour mixture while kneading until dough becomes soft and pliable.

        <li>Working on a flat greased surface, take a dough ball and flatten it using the <br>heel of your palm to make a paper-thin circle. Spread 1 teaspoon ghee inside it. Fold the edges <br>
            together to make roti into a square. 
            Repeat with remaining dough.</li><br>
